###贪心策略
```
贪心:当前阶段的解,可以由上一阶段直接推导出

遵循某种规则，贪心的选取当前最优策略，最终找到最优解
但当前最优未必是全局整体最优

  （1）建立数学模型来描述问题。
  （2）把求解的问题分成若干个子问题。
  （3）对每一子问题求解，得到子问题的局部最优解。
  （4）把子问题的局部最优解合成原来问题的一个解。

###举个栗子
1.硬币问题
有1元，5元，10元，50元，100元，500元的硬币各c1，c5，c10，c50，c100，c500枚
要用这些硬币支付A元，最少需要多少硬币，假定本题最少存在一种支付方案
0<=ci<=10^9
0<=A<=10^9

输入
第一行有6个数字，分别代表从小到大6种面值硬币的个数
第二行为A，代表需要支付的A元
样例:
输入
3  2  1  3  0  2
620
输出
6

2.快速渡河
A group of N people wishes to go across a river with only one boat, which can at most carry two persons.
Therefore some sort of shuttle arrangement must be arranged in order to row the boat back and forth so that all people may cross.
Each person has a different rowing speed; the speed of a couple is determined by the speed of the slower one.
Your job is to determine a strategy that minimizes the time for these people to get across.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T (1 <= T <= 20), the number of test cases.
Then T cases follow.
The first line of each case contains N, and the second line contains N integers giving the time for each people to cross the river.
Each case is preceded by a blank line. There won't be more than 1000 people and nobody takes more than 100 seconds to cross.

Output

For each test case, print a line containing the total number of seconds required for all the N people to cross the river.

Sample Input

1 2 5 10
Sample Output
17
